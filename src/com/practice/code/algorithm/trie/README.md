# Association_Rule_Mining_using_Trie  
###Implementation of Association Rule Mining in Java, using Trie data structure  

Association rule mining is a two-step process:  
1. Frequent itemset generation and  
2. Rule generation.  

Apriori algorithm is used to generate frequent itemset followed by rule generation.  
Support and confidence, the two statistical measures are used to refine itemset and rules, respectively.
